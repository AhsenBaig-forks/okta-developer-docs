<div class="oie-embedded-sdk">

Self service registration allows users to sign up for the app themselves.  In
this use case we will require the user to register with a **password** and an
**email** factor. To enable self service registrations, the following steps need
to be performed:

1. Enable the self service registration option for your app in the Okta org
1. Build the self service registration flow in your app

### New user registration generic sequence flow

Once fully integrated, the self service registration flow in your app will look
similar to the following;

<StackSelector snippet="sequence-flow-generic" noSelector />

The above sequence diagram illustrates generically how the required factors are
retrieved and verified within an app. For this use case, the loop in the
sequence flow will process two factors: password and email. Though not shown
above each factor verification is handled differently.

In this use case there will be two factors: password and email.  Password is
verified first with the user and then the email.

### Password factor sequence flow

The sequence flow for the password factor is shown below.

### Email factor sequence flow
After the password is verified the email is verified. The steps to verify the
email are shown below.

### Configuration updates
Before building out the self registration flow in your app, perform the
following steps to configure the Okta org to accept self registration with
both the password and email factors.

#### Step 1:  Update the profile enrollment default policy

1. In the Admin Console, go to **Security -> Profile Enrollment**.
1. From the Profile Enrollment page, click on the **edit** pencil icon next to the
   default policy.
1. From the Default Policy page, click on the **actions (â‹®)** menu item for the rule
   under Enrollment Settings.
1. In the Edit Rule page, select Allowed in the **For new users** section for
   sign up.

#### Step 2:  Confirm org application is assigned to everyone

   from the left navigation menu.
1. From the Applications page, select the **Assignments** tab:
1. Click on the **Groups** filter.
1. Confirm that the **Everyone** group appears in the Assignment list.

#### Step 3:  Remove security question authenticator from password policy

1. In the [Admin console](/docs/guides/quickstart/using-console/)
   (for the [Okta org](/docs/concepts/okta-organizations/) you set up in
   the previous step), select **Security > Authenticators** from the left
   navigation menu.
