## Configuration updates

Before you build the self-registration flow in your app, configure the Okta org to accept self-registration with both the password and phone factors by performing the following steps.

### Step 1: Set up your Okta org for password factor only use cases

If not already done, complete the steps described in [Set up your Okta org (for password factor only use cases)](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-password-factor-only-use-cases).

### Step 2: Set up your Okta org (for multi-factor use cases)

If not already done, complete the steps described in [Set up your Okta org (for multi-factor use cases)](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-multifactor-use-cases) section.

### Step 3: Ensure application is configured for password and another factor

   1. Click **Save** if an update was made.
